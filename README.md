# Tic-Tac-Toe
Learning to script and this is the first game I have made. I plan on adding more things like a score tracker, you can actually pick who gets to play what (x or o) instead of X going first, X/O showing the pattern not just a block of letters, scopeboard, AI, and more. 

REVISTED 03/12/2025:
I created this game to play with classmates while in a school house SCIF, unable to get access to the internet or anything better than what this was. It is pretty easy to see years later how much of a mess this is and what simple improvements can be made to increase player usability: Repetitive code, no win detection, file management, input validation, and as stated user experience are a few quick adjustments to be made.
